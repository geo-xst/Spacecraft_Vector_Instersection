Modifications:
--------------
The origin of the .obj model origin has been modified to match the origin as was described in Cassini's technical papers (e.g. Matson et al., 2003, doi:10.1023/A:1023609211620): The mag boom is aligned with the +Y-axis, the high-gain antenna (HGA) is aligned with the âˆ’Z-axis -- therefore the thrusters are towards the +Z-axis, and the X-axis is completing the orthogonal system.
