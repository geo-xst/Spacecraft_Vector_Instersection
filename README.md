# spacecraft_vector_instersection
The package uses a 3D model of a spacecraft and:
1) shows the field-of-view of an instrument and
2) determines whether a vector intersects any part of the spacecraft

Currently it is only for MATLAB - we are working on translating it for Python

This work will be submitted for publication


Notes:
-------------
- Some examples are provided
- (hopefully) it will be translated to Python soon
