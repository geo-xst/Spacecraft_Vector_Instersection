# spacecraft_vector_intersection
This is a package that can accept any spacecraft 3D model and:
1) calculate the field-of-view of an instrument
2) determine whether a vector intersects any part of the spacecraft
Additional there is a cript that visualises the 3D model.

Currently it is only for MATLAB - we are working on translating it for Python

Notes:
-------------
- Some examples are provided
- (hopefully) it will be translated to Python soon


MATLAB VERSION:
-----------------
The user needs to download and install (if required) the following packages, containing the required functions for the script:
1) for the stlread.m: "STL File Reader". Available at: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22409-stl-file-reader
2) for the readOBJ.m: "gptoolbox: Geometry Processing Toolbox". Available at: https://github.com/alecjacobson/gptoolbox/
